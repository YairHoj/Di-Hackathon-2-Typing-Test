        The longest paragraphs I work in are eleven lines. I don’t use them a
        lot. About eighteen months back, I wrote a long narrative piece about my
        grandmothers and the ways they used food. At just over seventeen hundred
        words, it was the first time I’d written in paragraphs that long, and
        marked the start of a shift toward length and biography in what I
        published.
